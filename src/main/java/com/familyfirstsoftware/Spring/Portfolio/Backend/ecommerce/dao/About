DAO / Repository (Data Access Object) and DTO (Data Transfer Object) are two design patterns used in software development, particularly in applications that involve working with data and
databases. They serve different purposes and are used to manage data in distinct ways.

DAO (Data Access Object):
DAO is a design pattern that separates the business logic of an application from the underlying data storage and retrieval mechanisms. It provides an abstract interface
to interact with a database or other data storage system. DAOs encapsulate the details of how data is accessed, allowing the rest of the application to work with a consistent
API without needing to know the specifics of data retrieval.

Key points about DAO:

Abstraction: DAO provides an abstraction layer between the application logic and the data storage, isolating the application from the details of database operations.
CRUD Operations: DAOs typically define methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on entities in the database.
Separation of Concerns: It helps separate concerns by isolating the data access code, making it easier to maintain and change.
Security and Validation: DAOs can handle security checks, data validation, and other data-related concerns.



In Java Spring, a repository is a key component of the Spring Data JPA framework. It's used to provide an abstraction
over data access and manipulation operations for a specific domain entity. Repositories make it easier to interact with
databases by offering a consistent and easy-to-use API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The primary purpose of a repository in Spring is to bridge the gap between your application's business logic and the
underlying data storage (usually a relational database). It abstracts away the complexities of writing raw SQL queries
or database interaction code, providing a more intuitive way to perform database operations.

Here's a breakdown of how a repository works in Spring:

Defining an Entity:
You define a domain entity class that represents a table in your database. This class usually corresponds to a row in
the table.

Creating a Repository Interface:
You create an interface that extends the CrudRepository or one of its subinterfaces (such as JpaRepository or
PagingAndSortingRepository). This interface should be parameterized with the entity type and the type of the entity's
primary key.

Methods in Repository:
Spring Data JPA generates various CRUD methods based on the method names you declare in your repository interface. For
example, if you have a User entity, Spring Data JPA will automatically generate methods like save, findById, findAll, delete, etc.

Custom Query Methods:
You can define custom query methods in your repository interface by using method name conventions. Spring Data JPA will
automatically generate the query based on the method name, reducing the need to write complex SQL queries.

Dependency Injection:
Inject your repository interface into your service or controller classes using Spring's dependency injection mechanism.
This allows you to call the repository's methods to interact with the database.

Here's an example of defining a simple repository interface in Spring Data JPA:

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {
    // Spring Data JPA generates methods like save, findById, findAll, delete
    // You can also define custom query methods based on method name conventions
    List<User> findByLastName(String lastName);
}
In this example, UserRepository extends the CrudRepository interface, which provides basic CRUD operations for the User
 entity. Additionally, a custom query method findByLastName is defined, and Spring Data JPA will generate the corresponding query based on the method name.

In summary, a repository in Java Spring, especially within Spring Data JPA, is a powerful tool for abstracting database
interactions and providing a consistent way to perform data access operations for your application's domain entities.
